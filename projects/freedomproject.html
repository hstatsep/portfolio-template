            <h1 class="margin text-center"> Freedom project</h1>
            <p>This project was a all year project where we had to create a website based on the topic we chose in the beggining of the year. Over this period of time, this project was based on everything we have learned from september to may( such as CSS, html and bootstrap). After we finished researching our topic and had good information about what our topic was and how it relates to music, we had to pick a tool to study to add onto our website</p>
            <ul>  The tool I chose was Aframe which  is an animation  to make your future innovations come to be displayed </ul>
            <ul> The topic I chose was music</ul>
            <h2> Content </h2>
            <p>As I chose my topic which was music and the tool I decided to pick was aframe. Throughout the two weeks  I had to make an animation using aframe and think how to show readers about the effects of technology and it's relation with music. I made a navbar, carosel, collapse and some boxes with colors. At the  bottom of the website I made an animation that displays music notes which is about my future ideas and how it pertains to my future idea. </p>
            <h3> Reflection</h3>
            <p>The challenges I faced was making my aframe show on my website</p>
            <p> The takeway of this was that  checking the website, youtube and asking for help is important because when I  asked my friend, he told me it was on the website so I looked and was able to find it </p>
            <p> Another Problem I faced was centering element's but when I looked at the code I realized I  added an extra div so I had to delete a div after section and it worked </p>
