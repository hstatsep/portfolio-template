            <h1 class="margin text-center">  Grade 10 Dating Simulator project(CYOA) </h1>
            <p>  The prompt for this project was to make a storyline in our ide using links, images and content. The project was called cyoa(choose your own adventure) and it was a partner group work in my case where I worked with Luis and the purpose of this project was to test our knowledge on github commands and communicating with our partners because if someone pushes a commit then they have to tell the partner when they pushed so the partner can pull. </p>
            <p>Once Mr Mueller gave us our group story based on a intrest form we did, we had to create  a dating simulator story where At first there is a player who is losing a game and is deciding to take a walk and rest their mind or stay and keep losing and is  based on what the choice  of the the user and the actions they take through two choices and the goal was to just get love and end the game, happyily  ever after.  </p>
            <p> Finally, Mr mueller assigned this project to communicate with our partners and to practice what we learned in class.</p>
              <ul>  Some challenges I faced was when I had to make images because I didn't remember how to link an image but then I looked at the readme.md and it explained the code to put an image and I was able to succeed</ul>
              <p> MY final steps if I had more time would be doing the extra credit to get more knowledge about creating a html instead of using markdown</p>
